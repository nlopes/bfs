# bfs - Bananas For Scale

Taking in the spirit of the Banana For Scale meme, we count lines of code in bananas.

# Example
![Bananas For Scale](./bananas_for_scale.png)
<img src="./bananas_for_scale.png">

## Assumptions

- we assume a banana size of 177.8 millimetres
- we assume a 10pt font on the Pica system - that's roughly 3.51 millimetres
- we assume that line spacing is 0.702 millimetres (10/12 ratio)

Therefore, 1 line of code is 3.51 millimetres + 0.702 millimetres = 4.212 millimetres.
